I am an advanced Biology student from Argentina, currently based in Buenos Aires. I am working at the [Laboratory of Biogeography and Systematics of Peracarida Crustaceans](https://dbbe.fcen.uba.ar/investigacion/grupos-de-investigacion/sistematica-y-biogeografia-de-crustaceos-peracarida/) at the University of Buenos Aires. My main focus is on the systematics of the isopod genus _Edotia_.


On this site, you can find my [academic publications](/publications), as well as the [outreach](/outreach) activities and publications I took part in.
