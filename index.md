# Welcome to my personal website!

I am an advanced Biology student from Argentina, currently based in Buenos Aires. I am completing my undergraduate thesis at the [Laboratory of Biogeography and Systematics of Peracarida Crustaceans](https://dbbe.fcen.uba.ar/investigacion/grupos-de-investigacion/sistematica-y-biogeografia-de-crustaceos-peracarida/) (UBA) where my main focus is on the systematics of the isopod genus _Edotia_.

Beyond my academic work, I am passionate about science communication. I enjoy designing original material for stands and talks, and have created videos and other audiovisual resources to bring biology closer to a wider audience.

On this site, you can find my [academic publications](/publications), as well as the [outreach](/outreach) activities and publications I took part in.
